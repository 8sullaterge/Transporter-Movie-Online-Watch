Another important factor is your pet shippers insurance. Ask about where they are insured and what the insurance covers because your pet shipping company should provide insurance against any harm that might come to your pet. For example, a Pet Care Liability Insurance is tailored to the pet service industry and covers if your loved animal has to go to the vet in an emergency.
 
One of the best resources in the online world is community-generated reviews. They will tell you how a company puts its promises into practice. Get on their social media web pages and check their Google reviews. If you see negative ratings, see how the companies resolved the issue rather than immediately dismissing them. Marketplace companies such as CitizenShipper offer the advantage that you can see both overall ratings as well as the reviews of every single driver. With this information, you can make a secure decision and find a shipper that fits your individual needs.

A medical marijuana commercial transporter license is a standalone license allowing the licensee, through its licensed transporter agents, to transport medical marijuana and medical marijuana products between other licensed businesses.

Applicants must provide documents establishing the applicant; and the members, managers, and board members, if applicable; and 75% of the commercial applicant's ownership interests are Oklahoma residents as required in the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana and Patient Protection Act, 63 O.S. 427.1 et seq.
 
A transporter license is issued simultaneously with commercial grower, processor, dispensary and laboratory licenses. It allows those licensees, through their licensed transport agents, to transport their own medical marijuana and medical marijuana products. Commercial licensees use their business account to apply on behalf of their employees for OMMA-issued transporter agent licenses. Anyone driving a vehicle transporting products between licensed businesses must have a transporter license and transporter agent license identification card.
 
A commercial transporter license is a standalone license for a business that transports medical marijuana and/or medical marijuana products between licensed medical marijuana businesses, through their licensed transportation agents. Transporters do not grow, process or sell their own medical marijuana. Transporter licenses are similar, but issued simultaneously with grower, processor and dispensary licenses for those licensees to transport their own products (through their licensed transportation agents).
 
A transporter agent license allows individual employees/owners/agents to transport medical marijuana on behalf of a licensed transporter, including growers, processors, dispensaries and standalone commercial transporters. Commercial licensees apply for the license on behalf of their employees. If approved for your license, OMMA will issue a transporter agent identification card to carry with you any time you are transporting medical marijuana.
 
Watch our videos. Transporter licenses are issued simultaneously with grower, processor and dispensary licenses. Transporter agents will need to work with the business that is employing them to submit the application through their OMMA business account.
 
Transporters may have multiple warehouses with the submission of one application fee, but a separate application must be submitted for each warehouse from the same online account. Each warehouse location must have a Certificate of Compliance.
 
Application fees will be paid by Visa, MasterCard, or Discover credit or debit card. An additional credit card processing fee will be added to the transaction. These application and processing fees are non-refundable. The payment will not be refunded for applications not approved.
 
A Transport Agent license appearing as active in OMMA Verify is active, even if the listed expiration date is in the past. Transport Agents who submitted a timely renewal application may use a Transport Agent license card with an expiration date in the past until receiving a new license card in the mail.
